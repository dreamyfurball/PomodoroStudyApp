# ⏳ Pomodoro Study App 🎵  

# Why I Built This
I wanted a personalized Pomodoro timer that keeps me motivated during study sessions.
Most Pomodoro apps are either too plain or too distracting, so I decided to create my own version with:

🎵 Custom motivational audio to keep me focused and engaged.
🕰️ A simple but effective timer with adjustable session lengths.
🔥 A tool that actually helps me stay productive, instead of just being another generic timer.
This app helps me stay engaged, avoid burnout, and get things done—and now, I'm sharing it with others who want a more immersive Pomodoro experience!
